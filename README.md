1) Download project
2) Open (csssrTask.sln file) in Visual Studio Community 2019 (version 16.3+ is required, as previous versions (16.2 and below) would not recognize the 3.0 .NET Core SDK)
3) Install Deveroom for Specflow extension (you need ro re-open studio after that)
4) Run test in Test Explorer tab (View > Test Explorer)

The test fails and this is expected because of the known bug with phone saving.
